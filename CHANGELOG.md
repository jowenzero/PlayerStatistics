## What's new?
* Added page numbers to shared content
* Clicking a highlighted name on a leaderboard now jumps to its page
* Now supports all versions from 1.20 to 1.21.4!

## Fixes
* Fixed incorrect formatting of highlighted leaderboard entries when command argument case doesn't match the player's name

As the number of supported versions increases, I cannot test them all manually â€”
please [create an issue](https://github.com/kr8gz/PlayerStatistics/issues/new) if you encounter any problems!
